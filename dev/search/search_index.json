Unless an environment is chosen explicitly , Hatch will use the default environment. Creation \u00b6 You can create environments by using the env create command. Let's enter the directory of the project we created in the setup phase : $ hatch env create Creating environment: default Installing project in development mode Syncing dependencies Tip You never need to manually create environments as spawning a shell or running commands within one will automatically trigger creation. Entering environments \u00b6 You can spawn a shell within an environment by using the shell command. $ hatch shell (hatch-demo) $ Now confirm the project has been installed: (hatch-demo) $ pip show hatch-demo Name: hatch-demo Version: 0.0.1 ... Finally, see where your environment's Python is located : (hatch-demo) $ python -c \"import sys;print(sys.executable)\" ... You can type exit to leave the environment. Command execution \u00b6 The run command allows you to execute commands in an environment as if you had already entered it. For example, running the following command will output the same path as before: hatch run python -c \"import sys;print(sys.executable)\" Scripts \u00b6 You can also run any scripts that have been defined. You'll notice that in the pyproject.toml file there are already scripts defined in the default environment. Try running the test command, which invokes pytest with some default arguments: hatch run test All additional arguments are passed through to that script, so for example if you wanted to see the version of pytest and which plugins are installed you could do: hatch run test -VV Dependencies \u00b6 Hatch ensures that environments are always compatible with the currently defined project dependencies (if installed and in dev mode ) and environment dependencies . For example, add cowsay as a dependency then try to run it: $ hatch run cowsay \"Hello, world!\" Syncing dependencies _____________ | Hello, world! | ============= \\ \\ ^__^ (oo)\\_______ (__)\\ )\\/\\ ||----w | || || Selection \u00b6 You can select which environment to enter or run commands in by using the -e / --env root option or by setting the HATCH_ENV environment variable. The run command allows for more explicit selection by prepending <ENV_NAME>: to commands. For example, if you had the following configuration: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.envs.docs] dependencies = [ \"mkdocs\" ] [tool.hatch.envs.docs.scripts] build = \"mkdocs build --clean --strict\" serve = \"mkdocs serve --dev-addr localhost:8000\" [envs.docs] dependencies = [ \"mkdocs\" ] [envs.docs.scripts] build = \"mkdocs build --clean --strict\" serve = \"mkdocs serve --dev-addr localhost:8000\" you could then serve your documentation by running: hatch run docs:serve Tip If you've already entered an environment, commands will target it by default.

If this doesn't reflect how you store the version, you can define a different regular expression using the pattern option: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.version] path = \"pkg/__init__.py\" pattern = \"BUILD = 'b(?P<version>)'\" [version] path = \"pkg/__init__.py\" pattern = \"BUILD = 'b(?P<version>)'\" The pattern must have a named group called version that represents the version.","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"version/#display","text":"Invoking the version command without any arguments will display the current version of the project: $ hatch version 0.0.1","title":"Display"},{"location":"version/#updating","text":"You can update the version like so: $ hatch version \"0.1.0\" Old: 0.0.1 New: 0.1.0 The scheme option determines the scheme to use for parsing both the existing and new versions. The standard scheme is used by default, which is based on PEP 440 . Rather than setting the version explicitly, you can select the name of a segment used to increment the version: $ hatch version minor Old: 0.1.0 New: 0.2.0 You can chain multiple segment updates with a comma. For example, if you wanted to release a preview of your project's first major version, you could do: $ hatch version major,rc Old: 0.2.0 New: 1.0.0rc0 When you want to release the final version, you would do: $ hatch version release Old: 1.0.0rc0 New: 1.0.0","title":"Updating"},{"location":"version/#supported-segments","text":"Here are the supported segments and how they would influence an existing version of 1.0.0 : Segments New version release 1.0.0 major 2.0.0 minor 1.1.0 micro patch fix 1.0.1 a alpha 1.0.0a0 b beta 1.0.0b0 c rc pre preview 1.0.0rc0 r rev post 1.0.0.post0 dev 1.0.0.dev0","title":"Supported segments"},{"location":"blog/","text":"Blog \u00b6","title":"Blog"},{"location":"blog/#blog","text":"","title":"Blog"},{"location":"blog/posts/release-hatch-160/","text":"Hatch v1.6.0 \u00b6 Hatch v1.6.0 brings improvements to build environments, better handling of dynamic metadata, and support for tools like Visual Studio Code. Build environments \u00b6 Originally, the environment interface method for providing builder sub-environments was intended to be used in conjunction with some cleanup logic in order to provide a fresh setup every time. However, this is unnecessary in practice because build dependencies rarely change. Without caching, repeat build environment use is slow which affects the following scenarios: the build command commands that read project metadata, like dep hash , if any fields are set dynamically Now a new environment interface method build_environment_exists is used by Hatch to determine whether or not it has already been created, for implementations that have a caching mechanism. The virtual environment type now uses this method to cache build environments. Project metadata \u00b6 Dynamically defined metadata is now supported everywhere, thanks to the new caching of virtual build environments. A project metadata command is introduced that displays the fully resolved metadata . The output format is JSON unless a field is specified as an argument. For example, if you checkout a project that is built by Hatch, like FastAPI , and run: hatch project metadata readme only the readme text will be displayed. If the content is in Markdown, then Rich will render it directly in your terminal: Virtual environment location \u00b6 The virtual environment type now uses a flat layout for storage in the configured virtual environment directory if the directory resides somewhere within the project root or if it is set to a .virtualenvs directory within the user's home directory. For example, if you define the following Hatch configuration: config.toml [dirs.env] virtual = \".hatch\" and the following matrix : pyproject.toml hatch.toml [[tool.hatch.envs.test.matrix]] python = [ \"3.7\" , \"3.8\" , \"3.9\" , \"3.10\" , \"3.11\" ] [[envs.test.matrix]] python = [ \"3.7\" , \"3.8\" , \"3.9\" , \"3.10\" , \"3.11\" ] then locating environments with the following command: hatch env find test will show that the general directory structure is: .hatch \u251c\u2500\u2500 test.py3.7 \u251c\u2500\u2500 test.py3.8 \u251c\u2500\u2500 test.py3.9 \u251c\u2500\u2500 test.py3.10 \u2514\u2500\u2500 test.py3.11 This flat structure is required for detection of virtual environments by tools like Visual Studio Code and PyCharm. Additionally, the virtual environment type now supports a path option to specify an explicit path that all inherited environments will share, such as the common .venv . Migration script improvements \u00b6 The script used to migrate existing projects from setuptools has been improved to handle more edge cases that were encountered in the wild and now no longer modifies the formatting of existing pyproject.toml configuration. Hatchling \u00b6 Hatch now depends on Hatchling v1.11.0 , which was also just released. Environment version source \u00b6 A new env version source is available that allows for the project version to be defined by an environment variable. Relaxed version bumping \u00b6 The standard version scheme now supports a validate-bump option that when set to false will forego the check when updating the version that the desired version is higher than the current version. This use case comes from Project Jupyter : A common pattern we use in Jupyter is to bump to a .dev0 minor version bump after making a release.

Build targets are defined as sections within tool.hatch.build.targets : pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.build.targets.<TARGET_NAME>] [build.targets.<TARGET_NAME>] For each build target you may override any of the defaults set in the top-level tool.hatch.build table. Build system \u00b6 To be compatible with the broader Python packaging ecosystem , you must define the build system as follows: pyproject.toml [build-system] requires = [ \"hatchling\" ] build-backend = \"hatchling.build\" The version of hatchling defined here will be used to build all targets. Hatchling is a PEP 517 / PEP 660 compatible build backend and is a dependency of Hatch itself. File selection \u00b6 VCS \u00b6 By default, Hatch will respect the first .gitignore or .hgignore file found in your project's root directory or parent directories. Set ignore-vcs to true to disable this behavior: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.build] ignore-vcs = true [build] ignore-vcs = true Note For .hgignore files only glob syntax is supported. Patterns \u00b6 You can set the include and exclude options to select exactly which files will be shipped in each build, with exclude taking precedence. Every entry represents a Git-style glob pattern . For example, the following configuration: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.build] include = [ \"pkg/*.py\" , \"/tests\" , ] exclude = [ \"*.json\" , \"pkg/_compat.py\" , ] [build] include = [ \"pkg/*.py\" , \"/tests\" , ] exclude = [ \"*.json\" , \"pkg/_compat.py\" , ] will exclude every file with a .json extension, and will include everything under a tests directory located at the root and every file with a .py extension that is directly under a pkg directory located at the root except for _compat.py . Artifacts \u00b6 If you want to include files that are ignored by your VCS , such as those that might be created by build hooks , you can use the artifacts option. This option is semantically equivalent to include . Note that artifacts are not affected by the exclude option. Artifacts can be excluded by using more explicit paths or by using the ! negation operator. When using the ! operator, the negated pattern(s) must come after the more generic ones. pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.build] artifacts = [ \"*.so\" , \"*.dll\" , \"!/foo/*.so\" , ] [build] artifacts = [ \"*.so\" , \"*.dll\" , \"!/foo/*.so\" , ] Explicit selection \u00b6 Generic \u00b6 You can use the only-include option to prevent directory traversal starting at the project root and only select specific relative paths to directories or files. Using this option ignores any defined include patterns . pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel] only-include = [ \"pkg\" , \"tests/unit\" ] [build.targets.wheel] only-include = [ \"pkg\" , \"tests/unit\" ] Packages \u00b6 The packages option is semantically equivalent to only-include (which takes precedence) except that the shipped path will be collapsed to only include the final component. So for example, if you want to ship a package foo that is stored in a directory src you would do: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel] packages = [ \"src/foo\" ] [build.targets.wheel] packages = [ \"src/foo\" ] Forced inclusion \u00b6 The force-include option allows you to select specific files or directories from anywhere on the file system that should be included and map them to the desired relative distribution path. For example, if there was a directory alongside the project root named artifacts containing a file named lib.so and a file named lib.h in your home directory, you could ship both files in a pkg directory with the following configuration: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel.force-include] \"../artifacts\" = \"pkg\" \"~/lib.h\" = \"pkg/lib.h\" [build.targets.wheel.force-include] \"../artifacts\" = \"pkg\" \"~/lib.h\" = \"pkg/lib.h\" Note Files must be mapped exactly to their desired paths, not to directories. The contents of directory sources are recursively included. To map directory contents directly to the root use / (a forward slash). Sources that do not exist are silently ignored. Warning Files included using this option will overwrite any file path that was already included by other file selection options. Default file selection \u00b6 If no file selection options are provided, then what gets included is determined by each build target . Excluding files outside packages \u00b6 If you want to exclude non- artifact files that do not reside within a Python package, set only-packages to true : pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.build] only-packages = true [build] only-packages = true Rewriting paths \u00b6 You can rewrite relative paths to directories with the sources option. For example, the following configuration: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.build.sources] \"src/foo\" = \"bar\" [build.sources] \"src/foo\" = \"bar\" would distribute the file src/foo/file.ext as bar/file.ext . If you want to remove path prefixes entirely, rather than setting each to an empty string, you can define sources as an array: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.build] sources = [ \"src\" ] [build] sources = [ \"src\" ] The packages option itself relies on sources. Defining packages = [ \"src/foo\" ] for the wheel target is equivalent to the following: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel] only-include = [ \"src/foo\" ] sources = [ \"src\" ] [build.targets.wheel] only-include = [ \"src/foo\" ] sources = [ \"src\" ] Performance \u00b6 All encountered directories are traversed by default. To skip non- artifact directories that are excluded, set skip-excluded-dirs to true : pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.build] skip-excluded-dirs = true [build] skip-excluded-dirs = true Warning This may result in not shipping desired files. For example, if you want to include the file a/b/c.txt but your VCS ignores a/b , the file c.txt will not be seen because its parent directory will not be entered. In such cases you can use the force-include option. Reproducible builds \u00b6 By default, build targets will build in a reproducible manner provided that they support that behavior. To disable this, set reproducible to false : pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.build] reproducible = false [build] reproducible = false When enabled, the SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH environment variable will be used for all build timestamps. If not set, then Hatch will use an unchanging default value . Output directory \u00b6 When the output directory is not provided to the build command, the dist directory will be used by default. You can change the default to a different directory using a relative or absolute path like so: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.build] directory = \"<PATH>\" [build] directory = \"<PATH>\" Dev mode \u00b6 By default for dev mode environment installations or editable installs , the wheel target will determine which directories should be added to Python's search path based on the selected files . If you want to override this detection or perhaps instruct other build targets as well, you can use the dev-mode-dirs option: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.build] dev-mode-dirs = [ \".\" ] [build] dev-mode-dirs = [ \".\" ] If you don't want to add entire directories to Python's search path, you can enable a more targeted mechanism with the mutually exclusive dev-mode-exact option: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.build] dev-mode-exact = true [build] dev-mode-exact = true Warning The dev-mode-exact mechanism is not supported by static analysis tools & IDEs, therefore functionality such as autocompletion is unlikely to work. Build targets \u00b6 A build target can be provided by any builder plugin . There are three built-in build targets: wheel , sdist , and custom . Dependencies \u00b6 You can specify additional dependencies that will be installed in each build environment, such as for third party builders: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.build.targets.your-target-name] dependencies = [ \"your-builder-plugin\" ] [build.targets.your-target-name] dependencies = [ \"your-builder-plugin\" ] You can also declare dependence on the project's runtime dependencies with the require-runtime-dependencies option: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.build.targets.your-target-name] require-runtime-dependencies = true [build.targets.your-target-name] require-runtime-dependencies = true Additionally, you may declare dependence on specific runtime features of the project with the require-runtime-features option: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.build.targets.your-target-name] require-runtime-features = [ \"feature1\" , \"feature2\" , ] [build.targets.your-target-name] require-runtime-features = [ \"feature1\" , \"feature2\" , ] Versions \u00b6 If a build target supports multiple build strategies or if there are major changes over time, you can specify exactly which versions you want to build using the versions option: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.build.targets.<TARGET_NAME>] versions = [ \"v1\" , \"beta-feature\" , ] [build.targets.<TARGET_NAME>] versions = [ \"v1\" , \"beta-feature\" , ] See the wheel target for a real world example. Build hooks \u00b6 A build hook defines code that will be executed at various stages of the build process and can be provided by any build hook plugin . There is one built-in build hook: custom . Build hooks can be applied either globally: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.build.hooks.<HOOK_NAME>] [build.hooks.<HOOK_NAME>] or to specific build targets: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.build.targets.<TARGET_NAME>.hooks.<HOOK_NAME>] [build.targets.<TARGET_NAME>.hooks.<HOOK_NAME>] Dependencies \u00b6 You can specify additional dependencies that will be installed in each build environment, such as for third party build hooks: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.build.hooks.your-hook-name] dependencies = [ \"your-build-hook-plugin\" ] [build.hooks.your-hook-name] dependencies = [ \"your-build-hook-plugin\" ] You can also declare dependence on the project's runtime dependencies with the require-runtime-dependencies option: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.build.hooks.your-hook-name] require-runtime-dependencies = true [build.hooks.your-hook-name] require-runtime-dependencies = true Additionally, you may declare dependence on specific runtime features of the project with the require-runtime-features option: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.build.hooks.your-hook-name] require-runtime-features = [ \"feature1\" , \"feature2\" , ] [build.hooks.your-hook-name] require-runtime-features = [ \"feature1\" , \"feature2\" , ] Order of execution \u00b6 For each build target, build hooks execute in the order in which they are defined, starting with global hooks. As an example, for the following configuration: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.build.targets.foo.hooks.hook2] [tool.hatch.build.hooks.hook3] [tool.hatch.build.hooks.hook1] [build.targets.foo.hooks.hook2] [build.hooks.hook3] [build.hooks.hook1] When target foo is built, build hook hook3 will be executed first, followed by hook1 , and then finally hook2 . Conditional execution \u00b6 If you want to disable a build hook by default and control its use by environment variables , you can do so by setting the enable-by-default option to false : pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.build.hooks.<HOOK_NAME>] enable-by-default = false [build.hooks.<HOOK_NAME>] enable-by-default = false Environment variables \u00b6 Variable Default Description HATCH_BUILD_CLEAN false Whether or not existing artifacts should first be removed HATCH_BUILD_CLEAN_HOOKS_AFTER false Whether or not build hook artifacts should be removed after each build HATCH_BUILD_HOOKS_ONLY false Whether or not to only execute build hooks HATCH_BUILD_NO_HOOKS false Whether or not to disable all build hooks; this takes precedence over other options HATCH_BUILD_HOOKS_ENABLE false Whether or not to enable all build hooks HATCH_BUILD_HOOK_ENABLE_<HOOK_NAME> false Whether or not to enable the build hook named <HOOK_NAME> HATCH_BUILD_LOCATION dist The location with which to build the targets; only used by the build command","title":"Build"},{"location":"config/build/#build-configuration","text":"All build configuration is defined in the tool.hatch.build table.

Version specifiers \u00b6 A version specifier consists of a series of version clauses, separated by commas. For example: pyproject.toml [project] ... dependencies = [ \"cryptography\" , \"click>=7, <9, != 8.0.0\" , \"python-dateutil==2.8.*\" , \"numpy~=1.21.4\" , ] The comma is equivalent to a logical AND operator: a candidate version must match all given version clauses in order to match the specifier as a whole. Operators \u00b6 Operators Function ~= Compatible release == Version matching != Version exclusion <= , >= Inclusive ordered comparison < , > Exclusive ordered comparison === Arbitrary equality Version matching \u00b6 A version matching clause includes the version matching operator == and a version identifier. By default, the version matching operator is based on a strict equality comparison: the specified version must be exactly the same as the requested version. Clause Allowed versions ==1 1.0.0 ==1.2 1.2.0 Prefix matching may be requested instead of strict comparison, by appending a trailing .* to the version identifier in the version matching clause. This means that additional trailing segments will be ignored when determining whether or not a version identifier matches the clause. Clause Allowed versions ==1.* >=1.0.0, <2.0.0 ==1.2.* >=1.2.0, <1.3.0 Compatible release \u00b6 A compatible release clause consists of the compatible release operator ~= and a version identifier. It matches any candidate version that is expected to be compatible with the specified version. For a given release identifier V.N , the compatible release clause is approximately equivalent to the following pair of comparison clauses: >= V.N, == V.* This operator cannot be used with a single segment version number such as ~=1 . Clause Allowed versions ~=1.2 >=1.2.0, <2.0.0 ~=1.2.3 >=1.2.3, <1.3.0 Version exclusion \u00b6 A version exclusion clause includes the version exclusion operator != and a version identifier. The allowed version identifiers and comparison semantics are the same as those of the Version matching operator, except that the sense of any match is inverted. Ordered comparison \u00b6 Inclusive comparisons allow for the version identifier part of clauses whereas exclusive comparisons do not. For example, >=1.2 allows for version 1.2.0 while >1.2 does not. Unlike the inclusive ordered comparisons <= and >= , the exclusive ordered comparisons < and > specifically exclude pre-releases, post-releases, and local versions of the specified version. Arbitrary equality \u00b6 Though heavily discouraged, arbitrary equality comparisons allow for simple string matching without any version semantics, for example ===foobar . Environment markers \u00b6 Environment markers allow for dependencies to only be installed when certain conditions are met. For example, if you need to install the latest version of cryptography that is available for a given Python major version you could define the following: cryptography==3.3.2; python_version < \"3\" cryptography>=35.0; python_version > \"3\" Alternatively, if you only need it on Python 3 when running on Windows you could do: cryptography; python_version ~= \"3.0\" and platform_system == \"Windows\" The available environment markers are as follows.

Direct references \u00b6 Instead of using normal version specifiers and fetching packages from an index like PyPI , you can define exact sources using direct references with an explicit URI .

If the environment is not part of a matrix or was not generated with the variable, you must specify a default value as an additional modifier e.g. {matrix:version:v1.0.0} . verbosity The integer verbosity value of Hatch. A flag modifier is supported that will render the value as a CLI flag e.g. -2 becomes -qq , 1 becomes -v , and 0 becomes an empty string. An additional flag integer modifier may be used to adjust the verbosity level. For example, if you wanted to make a command quiet by default, you could use {verbosity:flag:-1} within the command. args For executed commands only, any extra command line arguments with an optional default modifier if none were provided Matrix \u00b6 Environments can define a series of matrices with the matrix option: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.envs.test] dependencies = [ \"pytest\" ] [[tool.hatch.envs.test.matrix]] python = [ \"2.7\" , \"3.8\" ] version = [ \"42\" , \"3.14\" ] [[tool.hatch.envs.test.matrix]] python = [ \"3.8\" , \"3.9\" ] version = [ \"9000\" ] feature = [ \"foo\" , \"bar\" ] [envs.test] dependencies = [ \"pytest\" ] [[envs.test.matrix]] python = [ \"2.7\" , \"3.8\" ] version = [ \"42\" , \"3.14\" ] [[envs.test.matrix]] python = [ \"3.8\" , \"3.9\" ] version = [ \"9000\" ] feature = [ \"foo\" , \"bar\" ] Doing so will result in the product of each variable combination being its own environment. Naming \u00b6 The name of the generated environments will be the variable values of each combination separated by hyphens, altogether prefixed by <ENV_NAME>. . For example, the following configuration: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [[tool.hatch.envs.test.matrix]] version = [ \"42\" ] feature = [ \"foo\" , \"bar\" ] [[envs.test.matrix]] version = [ \"42\" ] feature = [ \"foo\" , \"bar\" ] would indicate the following unique environments: test.42-foo test.42-bar The exceptions to this format are described below. Python variables \u00b6 If the variables py or python are specified, then they will rank first in the product result and will be prefixed by py if the value is not. For example, the following configuration: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [[tool.hatch.envs.test.matrix]] version = [ \"42\" ] python = [ \"3.9\" , \"pypy3\" ] [[envs.test.matrix]] version = [ \"42\" ] python = [ \"3.9\" , \"pypy3\" ] would generate the following environments: test.py3.9-42 test.pypy3-42 Note The value of this variable sets the Python version . Name formatting \u00b6 You can set the matrix-name-format option to modify how each variable part is formatted which recognizes the placeholders {variable} and {value} . For example, the following configuration: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.envs.test] matrix-name-format = \"{variable}_{value}\" [[tool.hatch.envs.test.matrix]] version = [ \"42\" ] feature = [ \"foo\" , \"bar\" ] [envs.test] matrix-name-format = \"{variable}_{value}\" [[envs.test.matrix]] version = [ \"42\" ] feature = [ \"foo\" , \"bar\" ] would produce the following environments: test.version_42-feature_foo test.version_42-feature_bar By default this option is set to {value} . Default environment \u00b6 If the default environment defines matrices, then the generated names will not be prefixed by the environment name. This can be useful for projects that only need a single series of matrices without any standalone environments. Selection \u00b6 Rather than selecting a single generated environment, you can select the root environment to target all of them. For example, if you have the following configuration: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.envs.test] dependencies = [ \"coverage[toml]\" , \"pytest\" , \"pytest-cov\" , ] [tool.hatch.envs.test.scripts] cov = 'pytest --cov-report=term-missing --cov-config=pyproject.toml --cov=pkg --cov=tests' [[tool.hatch.envs.test.matrix]] python = [ \"2.7\" , \"3.8\" ] version = [ \"42\" , \"3.14\" ] [envs.test] dependencies = [ \"coverage[toml]\" , \"pytest\" , \"pytest-cov\" , ] [envs.test.scripts] cov = 'pytest --cov-report=term-missing --cov-config=pyproject.toml --cov=pkg --cov=tests' [[envs.test.matrix]] python = [ \"2.7\" , \"3.8\" ] version = [ \"42\" , \"3.14\" ] you could then run your tests consecutively in all 4 environments with: hatch run test:cov Option overrides \u00b6 You can modify options based on the conditions of different sources like matrix variables with the overrides table, using dotted key syntax for each declaration: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.envs.<ENV_NAME>.overrides] < SOURCE > . < CONDITION > . < OPTION > = < VALUE > [envs.<ENV_NAME>.overrides] < SOURCE > . < CONDITION > . < OPTION > = < VALUE > The type of the selected option determines the types of values. Platform overrides \u00b6 Options can be modified based on the current platform using the platform source. pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.envs.test.overrides] platform . windows . scripts = [ 'run=pytest -m \"not io_uring\"' , ] [envs.test.overrides] platform . windows . scripts = [ 'run=pytest -m \"not io_uring\"' , ] The following platforms are supported: linux windows macos Environment variable overrides \u00b6 Environment variables can modify options using the env source. pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.envs.test.overrides] env . GITHUB_ACTIONS . dev-mode = { value = false , if = [ \"true\" ] } [envs.test.overrides] env . GITHUB_ACTIONS . dev-mode = { value = false , if = [ \"true\" ] } Matrix variable overrides \u00b6 The matrix variables used to generate each environment can be used to modify options within using the matrix source. pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.envs.test.overrides] matrix . version . env-vars = \"PRODUCT_VERSION\" matrix . auth . features = [ { value = \"oauth\" , if = [ \"oauth2\" ] }, { value = \"kerberos\" , if = [ \"krb5\" ] }, ] [[tool.hatch.envs.test.matrix]] python = [ \"2.7\" , \"3.8\" ] version = [ \"legacy\" , \"latest\" ] auth = [ \"oauth2\" , \"krb5\" , \"noauth\" ] [envs.test.overrides] matrix . version . env-vars = \"PRODUCT_VERSION\" matrix . auth . features = [ { value = \"oauth\" , if = [ \"oauth2\" ] }, { value = \"kerberos\" , if = [ \"kerberos\" ] }, ] [[envs.test.matrix]] python = [ \"2.7\" , \"3.8\" ] version = [ \"legacy\" , \"latest\" ] auth = [ \"oauth2\" , \"kerberos\" , \"noauth\" ] Name overrides \u00b6 When a matrix is defined, the name source can be used for regular expression matching on the generated name, minus the prefix for non- default environments. pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.envs.test.overrides] name . \"^0\" . env-vars = \"TESTING_UNSTABLE=true\" [[tool.hatch.envs.test.matrix]] version = [ \"0.1.0\" , \"0.2.0\" , \"1.0.0\" ] [envs.test.overrides] name . \"^0\" . env-vars = \"TESTING_UNSTABLE=true\" [[envs.test.matrix]] version = [ \"0.1.0\" , \"0.2.0\" , \"1.0.0\" ] Types \u00b6 Literal types like strings for the Python version or booleans for skipping installation can be set using the value itself, an inline table, or an array. For example: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.envs.test.overrides] matrix . foo . python = \"3.10\" matrix . bar . skip-install = { value = true , if = [ \"...\" ] } env . CI . dev-mode = [ { value = false , if = [ \"...\" ] }, true , ] [envs.test.overrides] matrix . foo . python = \"3.10\" matrix . bar . skip-install = { value = true , if = [ \"...\" ] } env . CI . dev-mode = [ { value = false , if = [ \"...\" ] }, true , ] For arrays, the first allowed value will be used. Array types like dependencies or commands can be appended to using an array of strings or inline tables.

For example: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.envs.test.overrides] matrix . foo . env-vars = \"KEY=VALUE\" matrix . bar . env-vars = [ \"KEY1=VALUE1\" , { key = \"KEY2\" , value = \"VALUE2\" }, ] [envs.test.overrides] matrix . foo . env-vars = \"KEY=VALUE\" matrix . bar . env-vars = [ \"KEY1=VALUE1\" , { key = \"KEY2\" , value = \"VALUE2\" }, ] If the value is missing (no = for strings, no value key for inline tables), then the value will be set to the value of the source condition.

Unless an environment is explicitly selected on the command line, the default environment will be used. The type of this environment defaults to virtual . Inheritance \u00b6 All environments inherit from the environment defined by its template option, which defaults to default . So for the following configuration: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.envs.foo] type = \"baz\" skip-install = true [tool.hatch.envs.bar] template = \"foo\" skip-install = false [envs.foo] type = \"baz\" skip-install = true [envs.bar] template = \"foo\" skip-install = false the environment bar will be of type baz with skip-install set to false . Note Environments do not inherit matrices . Self-referential environments \u00b6 You can disable inheritance by setting template to the environment's own name: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.envs.foo] template = \"foo\" [envs.foo] template = \"foo\" Detached environments \u00b6 A common use case is standalone environments that do not require inheritance nor the installation of the project, such as for linting or sometimes building documentation.

For example, if you wanted to only use a private repository you could set the PIP_INDEX_URL environment variable . Installation \u00b6 Features \u00b6 If your project defines optional dependencies , you can select which groups to install using the features option: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.envs.nightly] features = [ \"server\" , \"grpc\" , ] [envs.nightly] features = [ \"server\" , \"grpc\" , ] Dev mode \u00b6 By default, environments will always reflect the current state of your project on disk. Set dev-mode to false to disable this behavior: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.envs.static] dev-mode = false [envs.static] dev-mode = false Skip install \u00b6 By default, environments will install your project during creation. To ignore this step, set skip-install to true : pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.envs.lint] skip-install = true [envs.lint] skip-install = true Environment variables \u00b6 Defined \u00b6 You can define environment variables with the env-vars option: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.envs.docs] dependencies = [ \"mkdocs\" ] [tool.hatch.envs.docs.env-vars] SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH = \"1580601600\" [envs.docs] dependencies = [ \"mkdocs\" ] [envs.docs.env-vars] SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH = \"1580601600\" Values support context formatting . Filters \u00b6 By default, environments will have access to all environment variables. You can filter with wildcard patterns using the env-include / env-exclude options: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.envs.<ENV_NAME>] env-include = [ \"FOO*\" , ] env-exclude = [ \"BAR\" , ] [envs.<ENV_NAME>] env-include = [ \"FOO*\" , ] env-exclude = [ \"BAR\" , ] Exclusion patterns take precedence but will never affect defined environment variables. Scripts \u00b6 You can define named scripts that may be executed or referenced at the beginning of other scripts. Context formatting is supported. For example, in the following configuration: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.envs.test] dependencies = [ \"coverage[toml]\" , \"pytest\" , \"pytest-cov\" , \"pytest-mock\" , ] [tool.hatch.envs.test.scripts] run-coverage = \"pytest --cov-config=pyproject.toml --cov=pkg --cov=tests\" run = \"run-coverage --no-cov\" [envs.test] dependencies = [ \"coverage[toml]\" , \"pytest\" , \"pytest-cov\" , \"pytest-mock\" , ] [envs.test.scripts] run-coverage = \"pytest --cov-config=pyproject.toml --cov=pkg --cov=tests\" run = \"run-coverage --no-cov\" the run script would be expanded to: pytest --cov-config=pyproject.toml --cov=pkg --cov=tests --no-cov Scripts can also be defined as an array of strings. pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.envs.style] detached = true dependencies = [ \"flake8\" , \"black\" , \"isort\" , ] [tool.hatch.envs.style.scripts] check = [ \"flake8 .\" , \"black --check --diff .\" , \"isort --check-only --diff .\" , ] fmt = [ \"isort .\" , \"black .\" , \"check\" , ] [envs.style] detached = true dependencies = [ \"flake8\" , \"black\" , \"isort\" , ] [envs.style.scripts] check = [ \"flake8 .\" , \"black --check --diff .\" , \"isort --check-only --diff .\" , ] fmt = [ \"isort .\" , \"black .\" , \"check\" , ] Similar to make , you can ignore the exit code of commands that start with - (a hyphen). For example, the script error defined by the following configuration would halt after the second command with 3 as the exit code: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.envs.test.scripts] error = [ \"- exit 1\" , \"exit 3\" , \"exit 0\" , ] [envs.test.scripts] error = [ \"- exit 1\" , \"exit 3\" , \"exit 0\" , ] Tip Individual scripts inherit from parent environments just like options. Commands \u00b6 All commands are able to use any defined scripts . Also like scripts, context formatting is supported and the exit code of commands that start with a hyphen will be ignored. Pre-install \u00b6 You can run commands immediately before environments install your project. pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.envs.<ENV_NAME>] pre-install-commands = [ \"...\" , ] [envs.<ENV_NAME>] pre-install-commands = [ \"...\" , ] Post-install \u00b6 You can run commands immediately after environments install your project. pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.envs.<ENV_NAME>] post-install-commands = [ \"...\" , ] [envs.<ENV_NAME>] post-install-commands = [ \"...\" , ] Python version \u00b6 The python option specifies which version of Python to use, or an absolute path to a Python interpreter: pyproject.toml hatch.toml [tool.hatch.envs.<ENV_NAME>] python = \"3.10\" [envs.<ENV_NAME>] python = \"3.10\" All environment types should respect this option.
